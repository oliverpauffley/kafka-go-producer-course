# Kafka Go - Twitter Producer
Following [Stephane Maarek](https://twitter.com/stephanemaarek?lang=en)'s kafka course.

## Running
Before running ensure the correct env vars are set. You will have to had a twitter developer account and application set up. Also ensure that kafka is running first.
```
TWITTER_KEY // key for twitter api
TWITTER_SECRET // secret for twitter api
TWITTER_TOKEN // twitter api token
TWITTER_TOKEN_SECRET // twitter api token secret
KAFKA_TOPIC // the name of the kafka topic (best practice is to create this first before running)
TWITER_FILTER // which word you want to watch for in twitter
```

## TODO 
- [ ] try with shopify/samara
